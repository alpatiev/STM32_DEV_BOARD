# SOURCES INFO

The "SOURCES" directory contains the following items:

1. CORE directory: This directory holds the main source files that serve as the firmware for the controller. 
It includes the primary function and other supporting functions that influence the runtime or are used in the STM32's lifecycle. 
Additionally, it contains the "data_types.c" file, which stores essential data structures used in the project.

2. COMPONENTS directory: Contains HAL abstractions over the "libopencm3" library to provide convenient access to peripherals.
These abstractions simplify the interaction with hardware components and facilitate reusability across different projects.
